            <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
            <p> One of the popular dishes available at any Chinese restaurant is Kung Pao Chicken. While generally associated with Westerners and the “westernized” Chinese cuisine, story of its origin can still be traced back to China.

            The story begins in the Guizhou province in southern China. As a young boy in the early 19 th century, Ding Baozhen accidently fell into water not knowing how to swim. Thanks to the quick action of a local, Ding was saved and went on to hold a government post in the Sichuan province. Wanting to reach out and thank the man who saved his life years ago, Ding visited the man and his family to express his gratitude. While there, the man served him a dish he had never had before , featuring diced and marinated chicken, peanuts, and spicy Sichuan peppercorns.

            He enjoyed the dish so much he asked for the recipe and started serving it to guests in his home as well. Not long after that, the dish spread across the province and took on the name Gongbao Jiding , named after the man responsible for its popularity.

            As time when on, the Kung Pao Chicken made its way into restaurants all around China and eventually North America, where westerners fell in love with the spicy and savory dish. A crucial element of the authentic, “Sichuan-style” version features authentic Sichuan peppercorns, although Western versions of the dish could not utilize them until 2005 when an import ban was lifted off the pepper.

            While the dish has remained quite popular in America and is still served happily in restaurants in China, the dish does not exactly hold the same clout . For one, chicken-based dishes are not as popular in China, as the meat produced locally is often dry and tasteless. As a result, chicken is generally imported from Japan. Also, most locals shy away from dishes that feature the starchy and syrupy suaces many American-Chinese restaurants feature.

            For any fan of bold and spicy flavors, Kung Pao Chicken is a must-try dish. At Chili House, we prepare our own Kung Pao Chicken with the same spices and peppers that were featured in the original incarnation of the dish.

            <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
            <p>Mongolian beef is a popular choice for many of those who at Chinese restaurants can't quite handle the spice of dishes like Mapo Tofu or Kung Pao Chicken. Its sweetness appeals to kids and even adventurous eaters tend to view it as a comfort food. The dish is made of flank steak, a lean (albeit sometimes chewy) cut of beef, with a marinade of brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic (via Dinner Then Dessert). The chewiness can be mitigated by slicing the steak thin enough.The dish is stir-fried at an extremely high temperature, typically around 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which causes the brown sugar in the marinade to caramelize along with the rest of the ingredients. Perhaps the telltale sign of this dish is the green onions or scallions added at the end. Variations on the dish can include mushrooms, broccoli, or cabbage.The name is somewhat misleading, as this dish doesn't come from Mongolia at all, but is instead a Chinese-Taiwanese creation. Since its introduction to the United States, where it's served atop steamed rice or fried glass noodles, it's become popular in America as well as the "Mongolian" aspect of the name was attributed to the dish because the dish was invented at Mongolian barbecue restaurants in Taiwan, where they first sprung up. <a href="#">back to top</a></p>

          <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
          <p> Japan has a rich history of cultural foods, and many of them have meanings behind them. One of those dishes is sushi. Sushi is one of the most popular dishes in the world and is loved by many people. This dish may seem simple, however it is a complex dish since the fish is prepared raw and must compliment the rice well. Sushi should be considered an art form because of the way it is prepared by the hands, and how the various colors of the fish compliments the white rice. Although sushi seems simple, it is prepared in a way that is enticing to the eyes and savory in the mouth. Sushi is commonly known around the world as a Japanese cuisine, however sushi has its roots in Southeast Asia. Sushi is confused with the modern way of making sushi that …show more content…
          That restaurant caters to several celebrities and requires a reservation before you can actually eat in that restaurant. Many high-end sushi restaurants require a reservation weeks, and perhaps even months before one can go and eat in there. To get a reservation at Nobu one must, of course, have a reservation. Nobu is notoriously booked and many people end up staying on auto-dial because it is hard to get your number picked up. For example, to get a table for four at Nobu on March 21, the party should call on February 21, a month earlier. The easiest way to get a reservation for Nobu is to get name-dropped, which means someone in there must mention your name to have a greater chance of you being able to get a reservation. Interestingly, Nobu does not have a bar to serve alcoholic drinks unlike many other sushi restaurants in the United States. To get alcoholic drinks, patrons are invited to walk down the block and have a drink at Tribeca Grill, a neighboring restaurant. The minimum amount for a sushi dish in Nobu is around sixty dollars, no less. Once seated, your chef comes to serve you. The chef may offer some recommendations that you can pick and the chef will make right in front of you. Like many other high-end sushi restaurants, Nobu serves only a piece of sushi for you on a …show more content…
          For example, McDonald’s has burgers; in the United States the burgers that are most popular is the cheeseburger or the bacon burger, while in Japan there is a fusion of cultures when it comes to McDonald’s. There are teriyaki burgers and shrimp burgers in Japan’s McDonald’s chain, the reason being because those types of cuisines and tastes is popular in Japan, shrimp and teriyaki is widely eaten in Japan and is a part of Japanese food culture. If the Japanese chain of McDonald’s did not have those kinds of options, then McDonald’s hamburgers wouldn’t be as popular as it is in Japan. This is the same phenomenon with sushi in the United States, the sushi is fused with different types of ingredients to cater to American taste buds; otherwise it would not have blown up as it did in the United States. <a href="#">back to top</a></p>
